Bike Tag
========

Bike Tag is a game intended to get people to share secret spots and
get out and learn about the city they live in.

The basic premise
-----------------
Someone posts a photograph of a spot, and everyone else tries to
identify the place. To prove you've successfully identified the spot, 
you must go to the same spot and take a photograph. This is verified by
your phone's GPS sensor at the time you take the photo. You won't know
that you're right (or wrong!) until you actually submit your photo. If
you guessed correctly - you are now in control. You have 30 minutes to
take a photo of a new place. Once you take your photo, everyone else
tries to identify *your* spot - and the game repeats itself
indefinitely.

The fun of the game comes from sharing interesting places in the city
with people who might not know about them. Or sometimes the fun is in
solving the riddle of the photograph - for example, maybe it's a really
common place, but the photograph is a little abstract with just a little
clue as to where it's taken from.

You can get to the spots via foot, bicycle, transit, I suppose a car
could work as well, but it'll be harder to find interesting spots in one 
of those!
